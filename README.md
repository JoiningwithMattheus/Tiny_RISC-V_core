# Tiny_RISC-V_core
Implement a single-cycle RV32I-like RISC-V CPU in VHDL and verify its behaviour with functional simulation in ModelSim. The implementation includes: Program Counter (PC), Instruction Memory, Register File, ALU, Immediate generator, Control Unit, Data Memory, and necessary multiplexers.
